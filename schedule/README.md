## Running the Script

Here are the simple instructions for running the `schedule.py` script file.

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) onto your computer if you haven't already. (I'm running Python 2.7.x, so be sure to use that version for best results.)
2. Go to the directory containing `schedule.py` in a terminal and run `python schedule.py`.
